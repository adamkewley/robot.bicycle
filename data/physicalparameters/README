This directory contains all collected data from measurement of robot bicycle
physical parameters.

To compute the physical parameters used in the model, run

  $ build_postgres_database.sh

This creates the database, creates the tables, populates the tables with all
quantities that were measured that were not time series (distances, etc.), and
finally adds all the time series measurements to the database.

Once the postgres database is successfully built, the model parameters can be
computed by running:

  $ python compute_model_parameters.py
